abstract: Driving behavior recognition is a key technology in human-machine cooperative driving, which plays an important role in the construction of an intelligent transportation environment. Due to the similarity of drivers ' actions and backgrounds in driving environments, it's challenging for existing behavior recognition methods to recognize behaviors in driving environments precisely. To solve these problems, we propose the two-stream (2+1)D CNN with Frame Difference Attention Module. First, we use two streams to process the information captured from the face camera and road camera and use the Squeeze and Excitation attention module to fuse the stream information. Second, we propose the Frame Difference Attention Module to enhance the changes between adjacent frames so that the subtle actions in driving environments can be captured easier. We test our network on the Brain4Cars dataset and have a good performance on it.
